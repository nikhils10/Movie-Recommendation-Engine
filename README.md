# Movie-Recommendation-Engine

## Project Overview 
Building a movie recommendation engine using different techniques like content based and collaborative based methods.
Content based techniques the content about the movie to recommend similar movie to you. For example if you liked a movie like "Batman Begins" it would recommend you 
similar movies like Batman. 

In content based technique we have taken the following features of movies like its title, director, top actors , genre and combined them as one feature .
Then we use word embeddings of 300 dimensions and generate cosine similarity matrix and find similar movies for that movie.

Collaborate filtering based techniques works by searching large groups of people similar to you and recommends you what they watch.
In collaborative filtering we explored multiple methods on the utility matrix like user based, item based collaborative filtering .
In user and item based we checked taking into account tough and easy raters by normalizing the ratings .
We also checked methods matrix factorization methods like Singular Value Decomposition



## Motivation
Watching Netflix and seeing how good it is at recommending me the articles. 
Very excited and feel this is a very cool area in data science and machine learning . 
Almost every service needs personalization for its users from movies on Netflix to songs on Spotify .
This can help in user retention and improving engagement .

## Problem Type
Content Recommendation

**Result Metrics**

For collaborative filtering :-
Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE),Mean Absolute Error(MAE).

## Actionable Insight
Trying different methods to recommend content to users and improve the service .
The better engine can help with better recommendations improving the platform user retention .
